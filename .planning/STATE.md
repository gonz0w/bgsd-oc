## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0-v7.1 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

- [v8.0 Research]: Use `node:sqlite` (built-in DatabaseSync), NOT `better-sqlite3` — preserves single-file deploy
- [v8.0 Research]: No backward compatibility aliases for command renames — single user, just rename and update all references
- [v8.0 Research]: Merge integration-checker→verifier, synthesizer→roadmapper (11→9 agents)
- [v8.0 Research]: Two-layer cache: in-memory Map (L1) + SQLite (L2) behind existing `cachedReadFile()` interface
- [v8.0 Research]: Graceful degradation to Map-only on Node <22.5 — zero crashes, zero warnings
- [v8.0 Execution 51-01]: XDG_CONFIG_HOME convention for cache database path, transparent Map fallback
- [v8.0 Execution 51-03]: Explicit cache invalidation on all gsd-tools file writes for immediate consistency
- [v8.0 Execution 52-01]: Cache warm with auto-discovery, --no-cache flag for test parity, auto-warm message
- [v8.0 Execution 52-02]: Hot-path commands wired to cachedReadFile, test parity verified
- [Phase 52]: Hot-path commands wired to cachedReadFile — Performance optimization: Use cachedReadFile instead of fs.readFileSync for .planning files in phase.js, verify.js, misc.js
- [Phase 53]: Created RACI matrix, implemented agent audit command — Each lifecycle step now has exactly one responsible agent
- [Phase 53-02]: Merged gsd-integration-checker into verifier, gsd-research-synthesizer into roadmapper — 11→9 agents
- [Phase 53-03]: Added token budgets to all 9 agent manifests (80k/60k), context builder warns on budget exceedance
- [Phase 54-01]: Implemented namespace routing in router.js — Supports init:, plan:, execute:, verify:, util: command prefixes with colon syntax
- [Phase 54-02]: Updated test command references to use namespace format — 126 plan: occurrences, all 762 tests pass
- [Phase 54-04]: Added automatic changelog generation to milestone wrapup — Creates vX.X-DOCS.md with git log and STATE.md metrics
- [Phase 55-01]: Added profiler instrumentation to hot paths — file reads, git operations, markdown parsing, and AST analysis emit timing data when GSD_PROFILE=1
- [Phase 55-02]: Created profiler compare and cache-speedup commands — enables before/after timing deltas with color-coded regression highlighting, cache effectiveness validation
- [Phase quick-3]: Deleted gsd-research-synthesizer and gsd-integration-checker from repo; updated all docs to 9-agent system, v8.0, 762 tests

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 3 | Audit codebase for stale links, old commands/agents, cleanup for release | 2026-03-03 | e620ea9 | .planning/quick/3-audit-codebase-for-stale-links-old-comma |
| 4 | Update all docs, remove stale docs, document v8.0 for release | 2026-03-03 | 4a974fd | .planning/quick/4-update-all-docs-remove-stale-docs-docume |

### Blockers/Concerns

- `node:sqlite` is Stability 1.2 (Release Candidate) — not yet Stable. Abstraction layer + graceful fallback mitigates.
- Node.js minimum version bump from ≥18 to ≥22.5 needed for SQLite — Node 18 EOL was Sept 2025, reasonable.
- Bundle at 1058KB (slightly over 1050KB budget) — monitor during v8.0.
