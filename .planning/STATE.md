## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0-v7.1 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

- [v8.0 Research]: Use `node:sqlite` (built-in DatabaseSync), NOT `better-sqlite3` — preserves single-file deploy
- [v8.0 Research]: No backward compatibility aliases for command renames — single user, just rename and update all references
- [v8.0 Research]: Merge integration-checker→verifier, synthesizer→roadmapper (11→9 agents)
- [v8.0 Research]: Two-layer cache: in-memory Map (L1) + SQLite (L2) behind existing `cachedReadFile()` interface
- [v8.0 Research]: Graceful degradation to Map-only on Node <22.5 — zero crashes, zero warnings
- [v8.0 Execution 51-01]: XDG_CONFIG_HOME convention for cache database path, transparent Map fallback
- [v8.0 Execution 51-03]: Explicit cache invalidation on all gsd-tools file writes for immediate consistency
- [v8.0 Execution 52-01]: Cache warm with auto-discovery, --no-cache flag for test parity, auto-warm message

### Pending Todos

None — milestone starting fresh.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `node:sqlite` is Stability 1.2 (Release Candidate) — not yet Stable. Abstraction layer + graceful fallback mitigates.
- Node.js minimum version bump from ≥18 to ≥22.5 needed for SQLite — Node 18 EOL was Sept 2025, reasonable.
- Bundle at 1058KB (slightly over 1050KB budget) — monitor during v8.0.
