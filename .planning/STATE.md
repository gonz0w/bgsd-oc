## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0, v1.1, and v2.0 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.
v3.0 decision: Intent Engineering as dedicated architectural layer (INTENT.md + per-phase tracing + validation).
v3.0 decision: Advisory validation model — flag drift, don't hard-block workflows.
v3.0 decision: Cascading intent — project-level INTENT.md + per-phase intent sections in PLANs.
Phase 14-01: HTML comments as section instructions in generated INTENT.md (no pre-filled examples).
Phase 14-01: Graceful parser degradation — missing sections return null/empty defaults.
- [Phase 14]: Compact show targets 10-20 lines with priority-sorted outcomes (P1 first)
- [Phase 14]: intent read is pure alias for intent show --raw (no separate implementation)
- [Phase 14]: ID gaps preserved on removal — getNextId() looks at max, not count
