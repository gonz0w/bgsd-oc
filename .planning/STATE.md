## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0–v3.0 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

v4.0 decisions:
- Structured assertions over Gherkin — 80% benefit at 20% ceremony, research-backed
- Static MCP profiling over runtime connection — known-server database sufficient
- Worktrees as deployment mechanism on existing wave system — not architectural change
- Bundle budget raised from 450KB to 500KB for new command modules
- [Phase 18]: Raised bundle budget from 450KB to 500KB in build.js — env module adds ~19KB
