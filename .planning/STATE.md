## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure derived from requirements — Foundation/tests first, then error handling, then DX, then build system, then performance
- [Roadmap]: DOC-01 (line count fix) grouped with Phase 1 to avoid a single-requirement phase
- [Research]: esbuild confirmed as bundler, lru-cache v10 for caching, both minimal additions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 needs config field alias mapping (3-way comparison) before CONFIG_SCHEMA extraction — research flagged this as a gap
- Golden fixture selection from event-pipeline needed before state mutation tests
