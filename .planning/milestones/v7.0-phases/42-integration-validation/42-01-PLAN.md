<objective>
Run the canary validation cycle: Plan Phase 44 → Execute Phase 44 → Verify Phase 44 completion. This exercises all v7.0 features in a real workflow.

Purpose: Validates that all v7.0 orchestration, context efficiency, and quality gate features work end-to-end
Output: Phase 44 plans created and executed, full cycle completion
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Plan Phase 44 (Review Gate Hardening)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/44-review-gate-hardening/44-*-PLAN.md</files>
  <action>
    Run the planning workflow for Phase 44 using current v7.0 tools:
    
    ```bash
    node bin/gsd-tools.cjs plan-phase 44
    ```
    
    This validates:
    - Orchestration intelligence (task_routing in init)
    - Context efficiency (agent manifests, compact serialization)
    - Git intelligence (branch-info for Phase 44)
    - Review integration (if Phase 44 plans use reviewer)
    - TDD execution (if Phase 44 has TDD plans)
    
    Phase 44 is Review Gate Hardening with requirements: QUAL-04, QUAL-05, QUAL-06

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Execute Phase 44 Plans</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/44-review-gate-hardening/44-*-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
    Execute the Phase 44 plans that were created:
    
    ```bash
    node bin/gsd-tools.cjs execute-phase 44
    ```
    
    This exercises:
    - Orchestrator task classification and routing
    - Context scoping via --agent flags
    - Compact serialization for plan state
    - Agent-specific manifests
    - Git trailer attribution (--agent flag)
    - Any TDD workflow if present
    
    Note: If execution hits errors due to v7.0 bugs, treat them as bugs to fix within this phase per CONTEXT.md

    Run verification on Phase 44:
    
    ```bash
    node bin/gsd-tools.cjs verify-phase 44
    ```
    
    This validates:

    - No blocking issues

  <verify>
    Phase 44 VERIFICATION.md exists and shows completed status

</task>

Canary cycle completes: plan → execute → verify on Phase 44 all succeed
