# Phase 72: Rebrand — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** All user-facing and internal references consistently use `bgsd-` naming — existing installs migrate automatically with no manual intervention

**Verified:** 2026-03-08  
**Status:** ⚠️ GAPS FOUND  
**Score:** 88/100

## Goal Achievement: Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| T1 | Config resolves from `~/.config/opencode/bgsd-oc/` | ✓ VERIFIED | `src/commands/agent.js:15` → `bgsd-oc`, `src/plugin/index.js:33` → `bgsd-oc`, zero `get-shit-done` matches in src/ |
| T2 | `BGSD_DEBUG=1` produces debug output, `GSD_DEBUG` no longer recognized | ✓ VERIFIED | `BGSD_DEBUG=1` → `[BGSD_DEBUG] file.cache: cache hit`, `GSD_DEBUG=1` → no debug output. Source: `output.js:190-191` checks `BGSD_DEBUG` only |
| T3 | `install.js` migration: detect → copy → remove old install | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 104-111: checks `OLD_INSTALL` existence, `cpSync()`, `rmSync()`. Lines 116-127: migrates `gsd-*.md` → `bgsd-*.md` agent files |
| T4 | Grep sweep returns zero old-pattern matches | ✓ VERIFIED | `grep -r` for `gsd-tools`, `get-shit-done`, `GSD_HOME`, `GSD_DEBUG`, `GSD_PROFILE`, `gsd-executor`, `gsd-planner`, `gsd-verifier` — zero matches excluding `bgsd-` prefixed strings |
| T5 | All tests pass | ✓ VERIFIED | 782/782 tests pass, 0 failures (128s duration) |

**10/10 agent files renamed:** `bgsd-codebase-mapper.md`, `bgsd-debugger.md`, `bgsd-executor.md`, `bgsd-github-ci.md`, `bgsd-phase-researcher.md`, `bgsd-plan-checker.md`, `bgsd-planner.md`, `bgsd-project-researcher.md`, `bgsd-roadmapper.md`, `bgsd-verifier.md`. Zero old `gsd-*.md` files remain.

## Requirements Coverage

| Req ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| RBND-01 | Config folder → `bgsd-oc` | ✓ Complete (not marked in REQUIREMENTS.md) | `src/commands/agent.js`, `src/plugin/index.js`, `install.js`, `deploy.sh` all reference `bgsd-oc` |
| RBND-02 | `GSD_HOME` → `__OPENCODE_CONFIG__/bgsd-oc` | ✓ Complete (not marked in REQUIREMENTS.md) | Zero `GSD_HOME` matches in src/, agents use `__OPENCODE_CONFIG__/bgsd-oc` |
| RBND-03 | `GSD_DEBUG` → `BGSD_DEBUG` | ✓ Complete | `output.js`, `profiler.js`, `safe-hook.js` all use `BGSD_DEBUG` |
| RBND-04 | `GSD_PROFILE` → `BGSD_PROFILE` | ✓ Complete | `profiler.js`, `router.js` use `BGSD_PROFILE` |
| RBND-05 | CLI binary → `bgsd-tools.cjs` | ✓ Complete | `build.cjs` outputs `bin/bgsd-tools.cjs`, `package.json` updated |
| RBND-06 | Agent files → `bgsd-*.md` | ✓ Complete | 10 `bgsd-*.md` files, zero `gsd-*.md` files |
| RBND-07 | Migration logic in `install.js` | ✓ Complete | Lines 104-127: directory migration + agent file migration |
| RBND-08 | All internal references updated | ⚠️ Partial | Zero old-pattern matches (T4 passes) BUT 18 `bbgsd-` double-prefix typos introduced |

**Coverage: 7/8 fully verified, 1/8 partial (RBND-08)**

## Anti-Patterns Found

| Severity | Location | Issue |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 🛑 Blocker | 9 files, 18 occurrences | `bbgsd-` double-prefix typo — agent path references like `agents/bbgsd-planner.md` point to nonexistent files. Introduced by Plan 03 sed replacement matching `gsd-planner` within already-correct `bgsd-planner`. |
| ⚠️ Warning | `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | RBND-01 and RBND-02 still marked `[ ]` Pending despite being functionally complete |
| ℹ️ Info | `src/commands/codebase.js:306` | Variable named `gsdBin` resolves to `bgsd-tools.cjs` — cosmetic inconsistency only |

## Human Verification Required

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Migration flow on actual old install | `install.js` migration logic verified by code reading; actual migration requires a real `get-shit-done` directory to test end-to-end |
| Deploy flow to live config | `deploy.sh` paths verified; actual deployment needs human `./deploy.sh` run |

## Gaps Summary

### GAP-01: `bbgsd-` Double-Prefix Typo (🛑 BLOCKER)

**Root cause:** Plan 03 ran `sed -i 's/gsd-planner/bgsd-planner/g'` across workflow/template files. Some files already contained the correct `bgsd-planner` from a prior bulk rename (commit `b5595f9`). The sed matched `gsd-planner` within `bgsd-planner`, producing `bbgsd-planner`.

**Impact:** 18 occurrences across 9 files. Agent path references (`agents/bbgsd-planner.md`) are broken — file doesn't exist. Slash command references (`/bbgsd-github-ci`) won't resolve.

**Affected files:**
- `workflows/verify-work.md` (1 occurrence)
- `workflows/github-ci.md` (3 occurrences)
- `workflows/plan-phase.md` (3 occurrences)
- `workflows/new-project.md` (4 occurrences)
- `workflows/quick.md` (1 occurrence)
- `workflows/research-phase.md` (1 occurrence)
- `workflows/help.md` (2 occurrences)
- `templates/context.md` (2 occurrences)
- `agents/bgsd-github-ci.md` (1 occurrence)

**Fix:** `sed -i 's/bbgsd-/bgsd-/g'` across affected files.

### GAP-02: REQUIREMENTS.md Tracking (⚠️ WARNING)

RBND-01 and RBND-02 are functionally complete but not marked as such in REQUIREMENTS.md. Administrative gap only — no functional impact.

### GAP-03: Variable Name Cosmetic (ℹ️ INFO)

`gsdBin` variable in `src/commands/codebase.js:306` still uses old naming convention. The value it resolves to is correct (`bgsd-tools.cjs`). Cosmetic only, no functional impact.
