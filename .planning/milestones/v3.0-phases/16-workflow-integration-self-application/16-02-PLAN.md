<objective>
Create GSD's own INTENT.md that captures the plugin's purpose, desired outcomes, and success criteria — dog-fooding the intent system on itself.

Purpose: SELF-01 requires GSD to use its own intent system. This proves the system works and provides real content for testing workflow integration (Plan 03 will verify workflows see this INTENT.md).
Output: `.planning/INTENT.md` populated with GSD plugin's actual intent.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create GSD's INTENT.md with real plugin intent</name>
  <files>.planning/INTENT.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/INTENT.md` following the template format from `templates/intent.md`. Use the project context from PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and AGENTS.md to derive real content.

**Metadata:**
```
**Revision:** 1
**Created:** {today's date}
**Updated:** {today's date}
```

**Objective:**
```
<objective>
A zero-dependency CLI plugin that provides structured planning, execution, and verification workflows for AI-driven software development.
The plugin turns unstructured project ideas into executable plans with traceability from intent through requirements to delivered code, optimized for single-developer + AI-assistant workflows.
</objective>
```

**Users:**
```
<users>
- Software developers using AI coding assistants (OpenCode) for project planning and execution
- Solo developers managing complex multi-phase projects with AI assistance
- The GSD plugin's own development workflow (self-referential: planning GSD improvements using GSD)
</users>
```

**Outcomes** (derive from v3.0 milestone goals + overall plugin purpose):
```
<outcomes>
- DO-01 [P1]: Every project captures why it exists and what success looks like in a structured, machine-readable format (INTENT.md)
- DO-02 [P1]: AI agents automatically see project intent in their context, aligning decisions with stated goals
- DO-03 [P1]: Work that drifts from stated intent is detected and flagged before execution (advisory, not blocking)
- DO-04 [P2]: Plans trace back to desired outcomes, creating full traceability from intent to delivered code
- DO-05 [P2]: Verification checks deliverables against intent outcomes, not just task completion
- DO-06 [P3]: Intent evolves across milestones with tracked reasoning for changes
</outcomes>
```

**Criteria:**
```
<criteria>
- SC-01: `intent create` produces valid INTENT.md; `intent show` renders it; `intent validate` passes
- SC-02: `intent trace` shows which outcomes have plans and which have gaps
- SC-03: `intent drift` produces numeric score; init commands show drift advisory
- SC-04: All GSD workflows (research, plan, execute, verify) receive intent context automatically
- SC-05: GSD's own .planning/INTENT.md is maintained alongside its roadmap
</criteria>
```

**Constraints:**
```
<constraints>
### Technical
- C-01: Zero external dependencies — Node.js standard library only
- C-02: Single-file CLI bundle (gsd-tools.cjs) stays under 450KB
- C-03: All intent operations are advisory — never block workflow execution

### Business
- C-04: Backward compatible — projects without INTENT.md work exactly as before
- C-05: Intent system adds value without adding ceremony — no mandatory steps

### Timeline
- C-06: v3.0 milestone ships all intent features (capture, trace, validate, integrate)
</constraints>
```

**Health:**
```
<health>
### Quantitative
- HM-01: Bundle size ≤ 450KB after all intent features
- HM-02: All tests pass (335+ currently) with zero regressions after each phase
- HM-03: Init commands complete in <500ms even with intent parsing

### Qualitative
Intent features should feel like a natural extension of existing GSD workflows, not a bolted-on afterthought. The advisory model (warn, don't block) preserves developer flow while adding alignment awareness.
</health>
```

Write the file directly (do not use `intent create` CLI — that would produce a skeleton). Write the fully populated INTENT.md with all content above.

After writing, validate:
```bash
node bin/gsd-tools.cjs intent validate --raw
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Validate structure
node bin/gsd-tools.cjs intent validate
# Expect: all sections ✓, exit code 0

# Show compact summary
node bin/gsd-tools.cjs intent show
# Expect: objective, 6 outcomes, 5 criteria displayed

# Show raw JSON
node bin/gsd-tools.cjs intent show --raw 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'outcomes: {len(d[\"outcomes\"])}, criteria: {len(d[\"criteria\"])}, constraints: {len(d[\"constraints\"][\"technical\"])+len(d[\"constraints\"][\"business\"])+len(d[\"constraints\"][\"timeline\"])}')"
# Expect: outcomes: 6, criteria: 5, constraints: 6
```
  </verify>
  <done>GSD's .planning/INTENT.md exists with 6 desired outcomes, 5 success criteria, 6 constraints, and 3 health metrics. `intent validate` passes. `intent show` renders correctly. The plugin is now dog-fooding its own intent system.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `.planning/INTENT.md` exists and has real content (not skeleton)
- `intent validate` exits with code 0
- `intent show` renders objective, outcomes with priorities, criteria
- `intent trace` can find this INTENT.md and map outcomes to phases
</verification>

<success_criteria>
GSD's own development uses INTENT.md to capture the plugin's purpose and guide planning. The intent system is self-referential.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-workflow-integration-self-application/16-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
