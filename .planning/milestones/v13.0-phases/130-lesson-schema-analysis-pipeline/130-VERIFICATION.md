# Phase 130 Verification Report

**Phase:** 130 — Lesson Schema & Analysis Pipeline
**Verified:** 2026-03-15
**Mode:** Initial

## Phase Goal

> Users can capture, list, analyze, and get improvement suggestions from structured lessons — with migration of existing free-form lessons and workflow hooks that surface suggestions after verify-work and milestone completion

---

## Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can run `lessons:capture` with all required fields and a structured entry is written to `.planning/memory/lessons.json` with auto-generated id and date | ✓ VERIFIED | CLI returns `{captured:true,id:"...",title:"...",severity:"HIGH",type:"tooling",entry_count:3}` |
| 2 | `lessons:capture` rejects entries missing any required field with a clear error message | ✓ VERIFIED | `--title "Bad entry" --severity HIGH` returns `Error: Lesson validation failed: - type is required - root_cause is required - prevention_rule is required - affected_agents is required` |
| 3 | `lessons:migrate` converts free-form `lessons.md` sections to `type:environment` entries | ✓ VERIFIED | `{migrated:1,sources:["/mnt/raid/DEV/bgsd-oc/lessons.md"],entry_count:4}` — entries get type:environment |
| 4 | User can run `lessons:list --type tooling --severity HIGH` and see only matching entries; `--since` filters by date; `--limit` paginates | ✓ VERIFIED | Filtered output shows count:2 from total:3; `--since 2026-01-01 --limit 2` correctly applies both filters |
| 5 | `util:memory read --store lessons --type agent-behavior --since 2026-03-01` works with new filter flags | ✓ VERIFIED | `--store lessons --severity HIGH` and `--type tooling` both filter correctly via lessons-specific block in `cmdMemoryRead` |
| 6 | `lessons:analyze` shows recurrent patterns grouped by affected agent — only groups with ≥2 supporting lessons | ✓ VERIFIED | Output shows group `{agent:"bgsd-executor",pattern_type:"tooling",count:2}` — single-lesson groups absent |
| 7 | `lessons:suggest` shows structured agent improvement suggestions — advisory only, never auto-applied, threshold ≥2 lessons | ✓ VERIFIED | Returns `{advisory_note:"These are suggestions only — review and apply manually"}` and excludes `type:environment` entries |
| 8 | `lessons:suggest --agent bgsd-executor` filters suggestions to that agent only | ✓ VERIFIED | `filter:{agent:"bgsd-executor"}` in output; suggestion count matches unfiltered because only 1 agent has ≥2 lessons |
| 9 | `lessons:compact` deduplicates when store exceeds configurable threshold — groups identical root causes, keeps latest | ✓ VERIFIED | `--threshold 0` → `{compacted:true,before:4,after:2,removed:2,groups_merged:2}`; `--threshold 100` → `{compacted:false,reason:"Below threshold"}` |
| 10 | `verify-work` workflow surfaces `lessons:suggest` advisory after verification completes (non-blocking) | ✓ VERIFIED | `workflows/verify-work.md` step `surface_lesson_suggestions` contains `node {bgsd-tools-path} lessons suggest 2>/dev/null || true` |
| 11 | `complete-milestone` workflow surfaces `lessons:suggest` at milestone wrapup (non-blocking) | ✓ VERIFIED | `workflows/complete-milestone.md` step `surface_lesson_suggestions` contains `node {bgsd-tools-path} lessons suggest 2>/dev/null || true` |

## Anti-Patterns Found

| # | Pattern | File | Line | Severity | Notes |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `analyze`, `suggest`, `compact` absent from `commandDiscovery.js` lessons routing map and `command-help.js` COMMAND_BRIEF/COMMAND_RELATED sections | `src/lib/commandDiscovery.js` (line 486–490), `src/lib/command-help.js` (lines 98–102) | — | ℹ Info | Discovery metadata incomplete for 3 analysis commands; CLI routing and COMMAND_HELP in constants.js are fully present. Tab-completion/fuzzy-match may not suggest these commands. Non-blocking. |

No TODO/FIXME/placeholder stubs found in `src/commands/lessons.js`.
The `return [];` at line 93 is the correct empty-array fallback for a missing/corrupt store file — not a stub.

---

## Human Verification Required

**None.** All must-haves are fully verifiable programmatically. The advisory nature of `lessons:suggest` output is textually confirmed by the `advisory_note` field in actual CLI output. Workflow hooks use the `2>/dev/null || true` non-blocking pattern, confirmed by grep.

---

## Test Suite Status

| Suite | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| Full test suite (`npm test`) | 1564 | 1 | Pre-existing failure: `bgsd_status returns structured data from live project` (plugin.test.cjs:379) — present before and after phase changes, confirmed in 130-02-SUMMARY.md |

Build (`npm run build`) passes cleanly.

---

## Gaps Summary

**No gaps.** All 11 observable truths verified. All artifacts exist, are substantive, and are correctly wired. All 9 requirement IDs covered. Workflow hooks confirmed non-blocking. Test suite at 1564/1565 (pre-existing single failure unrelated to this phase).

The one ℹ info item (`commandDiscovery.js` and `command-help.js` missing `analyze`/`suggest`/`compact` entries) is a minor metadata gap — the commands are fully functional, routed, and have COMMAND_HELP entries. Tab-completion may not surface them, but this does not affect phase goal achievement.

**Phase 130 goal: ACHIEVED.**
