<objective>
Tighten workflow .md files to reduce token usage — eliminate noise patterns, consolidate redundant instructions, and ensure consistent table formatting.

Purpose: Workflows are agent-consumed prompts. Every token counts. Tighter workflows = more context budget for actual work.
Output: All workflow files tightened with before/after line counts measured.

  <name>Task 1: Measure baselines and tighten top 10 workflow files</name>
  <files>workflows/progress.md, workflows/execute-phase.md, workflows/execute-plan.md, workflows/discuss-phase.md, workflows/new-project.md, workflows/new-milestone.md, workflows/transition.md, workflows/quick.md, workflows/resume-project.md, workflows/plan-milestone-gaps.md</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Measure baseline** — Record line count for each workflow file before changes.

**Step 2: Tighten each file** applying these patterns:
1. **Remove noise**: Delete "Starting...", "Processing...", "Done.", "Let's begin", "Now we will" patterns
2. **Compress instructions**: Convert multi-line explanations to single-line directives
3. **Remove redundant context**: If a step says "read file X" and then explains what's in file X, remove the explanation
4. **Consolidate similar steps**: Merge steps that always run together
5. **Tighten table instructions**: Standardize to `formatTable(headers, rows)` reference where applicable
6. **Remove filler words**: "please", "make sure to", "it is important to", "you should" → direct imperative
7. **Compress conditional logic**: Multi-line if/else → single-line ternary descriptions
8. **Remove dead references**: Any references to `--raw` flag that may have been missed in Phase 30

**Step 3: Measure after** — Record line counts and calculate reduction.

Target: 10-20% reduction across files. Don't sacrifice clarity for brevity — workflows must remain unambiguous.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT change the semantic meaning of any workflow step. Only tighten prose and remove noise.

  <verify>Compare line counts before/after. Verify each file is still valid markdown. Spot-check that key workflow steps are preserved.</verify>

  <action>
Apply the same tightening patterns from Task 1 to the remaining workflow and reference files:
1. Remove noise patterns (Starting/Processing/Done)
2. Compress multi-line to single-line directives
3. Remove filler words
4. Standardize table references
5. Remove any remaining `--raw` references

Also check references/*.md files for:
- Outdated brand references (GSD → bGSD)
- Verbose explanations that can be compressed
- Redundant content duplicated across multiple reference files

Measure before/after line counts for all files.

Compile a final reduction summary table:
```
| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
```
  </action>
  <verify>Compare total line count before/after. Verify files are valid markdown. Check no `--raw` references remain.</verify>
  <done>All workflow and reference files tightened. Reduction summary table produced. No --raw references remain. No brand inconsistencies.</done>
</task>

<verification>
1. Total line count reduced across all workflow/reference files
2. `grep -r 'Starting\.\.\.' workflows/ references/` — should return 0 or near-0
3. `grep -r '\-\-raw' workflows/ references/` — should return 0
4. `grep -r 'GSD' references/ui-brand.md` — should be 0 (all bGSD)
5. All files remain valid markdown

<success_criteria>
Measurable token reduction across workflow files. No noise patterns. Consistent table instructions. No --raw or stale GSD brand references.
