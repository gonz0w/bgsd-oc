<step name="init_context">
**Context:** This workflow receives project context via `<bgsd-context>` auto-injected by the bGSD plugin's `command.execute.before` hook. If no `<bgsd-context>` block is present, the plugin is not loaded.

**If no `<bgsd-context>` found:** Stop and tell the user: "bGSD plugin required for v9.0. Install with: npx bgsd-oc"

**Load progress context from `<bgsd-context>` JSON:**

Extract: `project_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `state_exists`, `phases`, `current_phase`, `next_phase`, `milestone_version`, `completed_count`, `phase_count`, `paused_at`, `state_path`, `roadmap_path`, `project_path`, `config_path`.

If `project_exists` is false (no `.planning/` directory):

```
No planning structure found.

Run /bgsd-new-project to start a new project.
```

Exit.

If missing STATE.md: suggest `/bgsd-new-project`.

**If ROADMAP.md missing but PROJECT.md exists:**

This means a milestone was completed and archived. Go to **Route F** (between milestones).

If missing both ROADMAP.md and PROJECT.md: suggest `/bgsd-new-project`.
</step>

<step name="load">
**Load structured data:**

```bash
ROADMAP=$(node __OPENCODE_CONFIG__/bgsd-oc/bin/bgsd-tools.cjs plan:roadmap analyze)
STATE=$(node __OPENCODE_CONFIG__/bgsd-oc/bin/bgsd-tools.cjs util:state-snapshot)
```

`ROADMAP` returns: phases with disk status, goals, deps, plan/summary counts, progress percent, current/next phase.
</step>

<step name="recent">
**Recent work:** Find 2-3 most recent SUMMARY.md files, extract one-liners via `summary-extract <path> --fields one_liner`.
</step>

<step name="position">
**Position:** Use `current_phase`/`next_phase` from `$ROADMAP`, `paused_at` from `$STATE`. Count pending todos via `init todos`. Check active debug sessions: `ls .planning/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v resolved | wc -l`
</step>

<step name="report">
**Generate progress bar from bgsd-tools, then present rich status report:**

```bash
# Get formatted progress bar
PROGRESS_BAR=$(node __OPENCODE_CONFIG__/bgsd-oc/bin/bgsd-tools.cjs util:progress bar)
```

Present:

```
# [Project Name]

**Progress:** {PROGRESS_BAR}
**Profile:** [quality/balanced/budget]

## Recent Work
- [Phase X, Plan Y]: [what was accomplished - 1 line from summary-extract]
- [Phase X, Plan Z]: [what was accomplished - 1 line from summary-extract]

## Current Position
Phase [N] of [total]: [phase-name]
Plan [M] of [phase-total]: [status]
CONTEXT: [✓ if has_context | - if not]

## Key Decisions Made
- [extract from $STATE.decisions[]]
- [e.g. jq -r '.decisions[].decision' from state-snapshot]

## Blockers/Concerns
- [extract from $STATE.blockers[]]
- [e.g. jq -r '.blockers[].text' from state-snapshot]

## Pending Todos
- [count] pending — /bgsd-check-todos to review

## Active Debug Sessions
- [count] active — /bgsd-debug to continue
(Only show this section if count > 0)

## What's Next
[Next phase/plan objective from roadmap analyze]
```

</step>

<step name="route">
**Determine next action based on verified counts.**

**Step 1: Count plans, summaries, and issues in current phase**

List files in the current phase directory:

```bash
ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

State: "This phase has {X} plans, {Y} summaries."

**Step 1.5: Check for unaddressed UAT gaps**

Check for UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (has gaps needing fixes).

```bash
# Check for diagnosed UAT with gaps
grep -l "status: diagnosed" .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null
```

Track:
- `uat_with_gaps`: UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (gaps need fixing)

**Step 2: Route based on counts**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| uat_with_gaps > 0 | UAT gaps need fix plans | Go to **Route E** |
| summaries < plans | Unexecuted plans exist | Go to **Route A** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 | Phase complete | Go to Step 3 |
| plans = 0 | Phase not yet planned | Go to **Route B** |

---

**Route A: Unexecuted plan exists**

Find the first PLAN.md without matching SUMMARY.md.
Read its `<objective>` section.

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**{phase}-{plan}: [Plan Name]** — [objective summary from PLAN.md]

`/bgsd-execute-phase {phase}`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

---

**Route B: Phase needs planning**

Check if `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` exists in phase directory.

**If CONTEXT.md exists:**

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {N}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}
<sub>✓ Context gathered, ready to plan</sub>

`/bgsd-plan-phase {phase-number}`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

**If CONTEXT.md does NOT exist:**

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {N}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}

`/bgsd-discuss-phase {phase}` — gather context and clarify approach

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/bgsd-plan-phase {phase}` — skip discussion, plan directly
- `/bgsd-list-phase-assumptions {phase}` — see the agent's assumptions

---
```

---

**Route E: UAT gaps need fix plans**

UAT.md exists with gaps (diagnosed issues). User needs to plan fixes.

```
---

## ⚠ UAT Gaps Found

**{phase_num}-UAT.md** has {N} gaps requiring fixes.

`/bgsd-plan-phase {phase} --gaps`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/bgsd-execute-phase {phase}` — execute phase plans
- `/bgsd-verify-work {phase}` — run more UAT testing

---
```

---

**Step 3: Check milestone status (only when phase complete)**

Read ROADMAP.md and identify:
1. Current phase number
2. All phase numbers in the current milestone section

Count total phases and identify the highest phase number.

State: "Current phase is {X}. Milestone has {N} phases (highest: {Y})."

**Route based on milestone status:**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| current phase < highest phase | More phases remain | Go to **Route C** |
| current phase = highest phase | Milestone complete | Go to **Route D** |

---

**Route C: Phase complete, more phases remain**

Read ROADMAP.md to get the next phase's name and goal.

```
---

## ✓ Phase {Z} Complete

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {Z+1}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}

`/bgsd-discuss-phase {Z+1}` — gather context and clarify approach

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/bgsd-plan-phase {Z+1}` — skip discussion, plan directly
- `/bgsd-verify-work {Z}` — user acceptance test before continuing

---
```

---

**Route D: Milestone complete**

```
---

## 🎉 Milestone Complete

All {N} phases finished!

## ▶ Next Up

**Complete Milestone** — archive and prepare for next

`/bgsd-complete-milestone`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/bgsd-verify-work` — user acceptance test before completing milestone

---
```

---

**Route F: Between milestones (ROADMAP.md missing, PROJECT.md exists)**

A milestone was completed and archived. Ready to start the next milestone cycle.

Read MILESTONES.md to find the last completed milestone version.

```
---

## ✓ Milestone v{X.Y} Complete

Ready to plan the next milestone.

## ▶ Next Up

**Start Next Milestone** — questioning → research → requirements → roadmap

`/bgsd-new-milestone`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

</step>

<step name="edge_cases">
**Edge cases:** Phase complete but unplanned → offer `/bgsd-plan-phase [next]`. All complete → milestone completion. Blockers → highlight first. Handoff exists → mention, offer `/bgsd-resume-work`.
